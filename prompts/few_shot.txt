Q: What is the value of x in the equation 2x + 6 = 10?
A: Subtract 6 from both sides: 2x = 4. Divide both sides by 2: x = 2.

Q: Solve for x: 4x - 3 = 9
A: Add 3 to both sides: 4x = 12. Divide both sides by 4: x = 3.

Q: Combine like terms: 2x + 3x - 4
A: 2x and 3x are like terms. Combine them: 5x - 4.

Q: Evaluate the expression: 2(3 + 4) - 5
A: First calculate inside the parentheses: 3 + 4 = 7. Then multiply: 2 * 7 = 14. Subtract 5: 14 - 5 = 9.
